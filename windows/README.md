# Windows

Scripts for effortlessly setting up a new Windows installation. Includes installing essential software and configuring settings according to my taste. 

## How to use

Run `setup.cmd` as an administrator. This script will then call all other scripts automatically and does not require any user interaction until the end.

The setup consits of the following steps:
-   Removing unnecessary software that comes preinstalled
-   Configuring settings
-   Installing software using [chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/)
