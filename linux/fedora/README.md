# Fedora

Scripts for effortlessly setting up a new Fedora installation. Includes installing essential software and configuring settings according to my taste. 

## How to use

Run `fedora_post_install.sh` with sudo. This script will then call all other scripts automatically.

The post installation script consists of the following steps:
- Updating the system
- Removing unnecessary software that comes preinstalled
- Installing software using package managers
- Configuring settings
